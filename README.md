# C-function

Task 1
Create function IsSorted, determining whether a given array of integer
values of arbitrary length is sorted in a given order (the order is set up by
enum value SortOrder). Array and sort order are passed by parameters.
Function does not change the array.

Task 2.
Create function Transform, replacing the value of each element of an
integer array with the sum of this element value and its index, only if the
given array is sorted in the given order (the order is set up by enum value
SortOrder). Array and sort order are passed by parameters. To check, if
the array is sorted, the function IsSorted from the Task 1 is called.

Task 3.
Create function MultArithmeticElements, which determines the
multiplication of the first n elements of arithmetic progression of real
numbers with a given initial element of progression a1 and progression step
t. an is calculated by the formula (an+1 = an + t).

Task 4.
Create function SumGeometricElements, determining the sum of the first
elements of a decreasing geometric progression of real numbers with a
given initial element of a progression a1 and a given progression step t,
while the last element must be greater than a given alim. an is calculated
by the formula (an+1 = an * t), 0<t<1 .
